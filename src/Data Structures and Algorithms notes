DSA Roadmap=>

* Beginner Level
- Language Basics
- Basic control statements and pattern programs
- Strings and few concepts around strings=> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-string-coding-problems-for-interviews/
- Basic Data structures implementations=> ArrayList,LinkedList,stack, Queue, Hashmap/set, Heaps
- Array Searching Algorithms with advance use cases => Linear search, Binary search, Ternary search
- Repeatative array algorithms => Kadane's algo, DNF, Prefix sum, 2 pointers, sliding window, Transform and Conquer Approach, Slow fast pointer,
                                  Divide and Conquer, Mono queue, Streams, randomised algorithm
- Recursion and Backtracking patterns=> subset,subarray, permutation, recursive to iterative and vice-versa, DFS-BFS
- Sorting Algo's
- Questions based on these above topics.

* Advance Level
- Heap
- Trees=> BST, AVL, Red Black
- Graphs=> DFS, BFS, topological sort, dijkstra's algo,
-
